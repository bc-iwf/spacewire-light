# Spacewire Light
SpaceWire Light is a SpaceWire encoder-decoder with FIFO interface.

Original Project page at OpenCores:  http://opencores.org/project,spacewire_light

The SpaceWire Light core was adapted to the ÖAW / IWF coding guidelines by Jorge Tonfat (jorge.tonfat at oeaw dot ac dot at)

A detailed list of function changes to the original code can be found in the dedicated VHDL file.

Overview
--------

SpaceWire Light is a SpaceWire encoder-decoder.
It is synthesizable for FPGA targets (up to 200 Mbit on Spartan-3).
Application interfaces include a simple FIFO interface, as well as
an AMBA bus interface for LEON3 system-on-chip designs.

The goal is to provide a complete, reliable, fast implementation
of a SpaceWire encoder-decoder according to ECSS-E-ST-50-12C.
The core is "light" in the sense that it does not provide additional
features such as RMAP, routing etc.

SpaceWire Light supports two application interfaces. One interface
provides FIFO-style access to RX/TX buffers in the core (spwstream).
This interface can be easily integrated into most digital designs.

Alternatively, an AMBA bus interface (spwamba) may be used to integrate
SpaceWire Light into a LEON3 embedded system. This interface supports
DMA-based data transfers. The code for the AMBA interface depends on GRLIB,
a VHDL library from Aeroflex Gaisler. The source of GRLIB must be downloaded
separately from http://www.gaisler.com/.
